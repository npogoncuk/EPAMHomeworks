### Task 2

Checkout [CameraAppTask](https://github.com/Maksym-Motornyi/CameraPermissionTask)

1. Add Camera permission to manifest.

2. Request Camera runtime permission before launch camera.

3. Add explanation BEFORE requestiing permission of why do we need this permission.

3. Handle the scenario when user denied Camera permisson.

4. BONUS: handle the scenario when the user denied permission with "Never ask again option".

All this tasks can be done in MainActivity so there are no necessity to modify other code. But you can if you want to experiment ;)

It's better to use existing methods launchCamera() and openSettings() as is (without modification). You can use AlertDialog to interact with user (an example of AlertDialog is in CameraActivity, copy paste it as much times as you need)
